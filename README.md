# ♛ N-Queen Visualizer

An interactive and educational visualizer for the classic **N-Queens Problem**, built to apply and demonstrate algorithmic thinking and front-end development skills. This tool animates all valid placements of queens on an `N x N` chessboard using backtracking.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 Visual representation of all valid N-Queens problem solutions.
- ⚡ Adjustable speed slider to control visualization pace.
- 👑 Clean, responsive, and interactive UI.
- ✅ User input validation for board sizes.
- 📊 Dynamic display of the total number of valid arrangements.

## 🧠 Why This Project?

This project was built as a hands-on application of core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts, particularly:

- ✅ Backtracking (core algorithm for queen placement)
- ✅ Recursion (exploring all possible board states)
- ✅ State management (tracking positions of queens)
- ✅ DOM manipulation and asynchronous visualization using JavaScript

> It not only helped strengthen problem-solving techniques but also bridged the gap between **theory and practical implementation**.

## 📚 About the N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens problem challenges you to:
> Place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other (no same row, column, or diagonal).
